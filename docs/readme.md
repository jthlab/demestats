# momi3 (within demestats)

momi (short for MOran Models for Inference) is a Python package for computing the
expected sample frequency spectrum (SFS) and using it to infer demographic history.

This third version is a complete rewrite of the original momi and momi2 packages. It
introduces greater flexibility in model specification and improved performance.

momi3 is implemented as a **component of** the broader `demestats` package (primarily in
`demestats.sfs`). For installation instructions, tutorials, and API reference, see the
documentation pages in this site.

The method is described in the following preprint:
